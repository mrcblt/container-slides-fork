## View existing talks

My talks are published a [releases on the GitHub repository](https://github.com/nicholasdille/container-slides/releases)

The release contains a direct link to the HTML file

Compile slides by running `make`

Talks are hard to view locally because of CORS (`CORS request not http`)

Option 1: Run `serve.sh`

```plaintext
bash serve.sh
```

Option 2: Use the Visual Studio Code [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension
